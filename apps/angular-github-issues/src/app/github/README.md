## Synopsis

The github application searches github for repositories, and displays bar charts some relevant information about it. You can then drill down into the repositories to find information about the issues of the repository.

Authentication has been implmented with Oath2. This will up the github query rate per hour.

This lazy loaded module I consider to be a stand alone library/application. I can put it in its own npm package and lazy load it if I wanted to.
