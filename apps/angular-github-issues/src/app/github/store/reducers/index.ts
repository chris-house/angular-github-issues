 * Every reducer module exports selector functions, however child reducers
 * have no knowledge of the overall state tree. To make them useable, we

 *
 * The createSelector function from the reselect library creates
 * very efficient selectors that are memoized and only recompute when arguments change.
 * The created selectors can also be composed together to select different
 * pieces of state.
